# Webapp-Azure-VM
This project deploys a Flask based calculator web app using two of the compute services provided by Microsoft Azure.

## Azure Virtual Machines (VM)
Azure VM's is one of several types of on-demand, scalable computing resources that Azure offers. 
An Azure VM gives you the flexibility of virtualization without having to buy and maintain the physical hardware that runs it. However, you still need to maintain the VM by performing tasks, such as configuring, patching, and installing the software that runs on it.

## Azure App Service
Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. You can develop in your favorite language, be it .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. Applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments.

## WebApp
To run the code on local device:
```
1. clone the repository
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python application.py
```
The Flask app will run on http://localhost:3000/ by default.
